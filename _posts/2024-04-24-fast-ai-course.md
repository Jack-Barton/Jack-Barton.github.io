# The Multiclass Classifier (CIFAR10 Classes)

## Is it a airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship or truck?

The basic steps taken are as follows:
1. Use DuckDuckGo to search for images of airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships and trucks
1. Fine-tune a pretrained neural network to recognise these groups (resnet18)
1. Try running this model on a picture of an airplane and see if it works.

A multiclass image classifier is a nural network (NN) that can be passed the pixel values of an image and output a correlation percentage for each class being analysed.
