## How to Blog
Here are the instructions on how to set up a basic blog https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html. 

All pages on the blog, including this one, use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Edit the `index.md` file to change the home page content. 

To add tabs at the top right add a `*.md` file to the `*.github.io` directory and add a title with the Tab name you want.

Add posts by making a `*.md` file in the `_posts` directory with name format `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`
